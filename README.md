CMU Custodial Delivery App

Contributions:

Dakota focused mainly on the main app (mainApp.py and all the files it needs to run) that would be used by the Admins in the Custodial office. He also put time into the flask side of the project (mostly used in network.py) to get the web app running on the campus wifi.

Dalton's main focus was the html and javascript side of things. This would be the visual aspect of the web app (which is ran with network.py) and getting all of the web app information to save to the same places as the main app.

Much of the work was done while working together so many of the framework files (save.py, graphics.py, delivery.py etc) we both worked together, and once they worked didn't really need to go back to them. The Web App was the main functionality we wanted to add into the project so most of this work was done together, while much of the research on the tools we used (Flask for example) was on our separate time.
